# HR-Onboarding-AI-Agent

Perfect — you’re now inside the *HR Onboarding Workflow → Parameters* screen ✅
This is where we define the *inputs* that your agent will collect from the user (like role, location, joining date).

Right now it shows *Inputs (0)* — that means no inputs are created yet.
Let’s add them *one by one*, exactly what to click and what to type.

---

# ✅ STEP-BY-STEP: ADD WORKFLOW INPUTS

You will add *3 inputs*:

1. Employee Role
2. Location
3. Joining Date

Each one is added using the *“Add input”* button.

---

## ✅ INPUT 1: Employee Role

### ⿡ Click:

➡ *Add input*

A small form will open. Fill it like this:

* *Type:* Text
* *Name:*


employee_role


* *Description:*


Job role of the new employee (example: Java Developer, HR Executive)


* *Default:* (leave empty)
* ✅ *Required:* Turn ON ✅

➡ Click *Save* / *Add*

---

## ✅ INPUT 2: Employee Location

Again click:
➡ *Add input*

Fill like this:

* *Type:* Text
* *Name:*


employee_location


* *Description:*


Office location of the new employee (example: Mumbai, Bangalore)


* *Default:* (leave empty)
* ✅ *Required:* Turn ON ✅

➡ Click *Save* / *Add*

## ✅ INPUT 3: Joining Date

Again click:
➡ *Add input*

Fill like this:

* *Type:* Text  (or Date, if Date type is available)
* *Name:*


start_date


* *Description:*


Joining date of the new employee


* *Default:* (leave empty)

➡ Click *Save* / *Add*

## ✅ FINAL CHECK (VERY IMPORTANT)

After adding all 3, your screen should show:

| Type | Name              | Description              |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Text | employee_role     | Job role of new employee |
| Text | employee_location | Office location          |
| Text | start_date        | Joining date             |

Now click the *blue “Done” button* at the bottom right ✅

---

# ✅ WHAT THIS DOES FOR YOUR AGENT

Now your agent can ask:

* “What is your role?”
* “Which location?”
* “What is your joining date?”

And it will *automatically pass these into the onboarding workflow* to generate:

* ✅ Day 1 plan
* ✅ Week 1 plan
* ✅ Welcome email

---

# ✅ NEXT STEP (VERY IMPORTANT)

After you click *Done*, go back to:

➡ *Toolset → HR Onboarding Workflow → Open Workflow Canvas*

Then send me:

* A photo of the *workflow canvas screen*

I will then guide you to:
✅ Add *AI steps*
✅ Generate onboarding checklist
✅ Generate welcome email
✅ Display the final output
